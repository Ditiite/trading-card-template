## trading-card-template
This is a template for styling individual cards for the Trading Cards Website

## What to do
1. Download the repository
2. Open the files in your text editor (Atom, Sublime Text etc...)
3. Copy and paste your card content to the index.html file
4. Add your styles to the styles.CSS file, but only to the declarations that start with #card-100 selector
  * Don't change or add any class selectors, just transfer your style declarations to the template
  * Remove all width and height properties (cards should be [responsive](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp)
  * You will most likely have to add padding, margins, font-size and line-height properties - I have added empty declaration to places that this is most likely
  * Submit your card by copying and pasting the part of the code you have made changes to [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/paw-prints-paw-prints-animal-trading-card-project-for-everyone-to-take-part-in-paw-prints-paw-prints/523110)
